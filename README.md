# GolfBets

**Stage:** 2 (Prototype) → 3 (Pilot)

## One-liner
On-course side games, frictionless: **set up fast, enter fast, settle fast**.

Mantra: **Less math, fewer arguments.**

## Repo map (added docs)
- `docs/` — assumptions, decisions, testing, instrumentation
- `research/` — interview notes + artifacts
- `prototype/` — fixtures, golden outputs
- `product/` — backlog + definition of done
- `ops/` — release checklist + runbook

## How we work
Start here:
- `docs/PLAYBOOK.md`
- `docs/ASSUMPTIONS.md`
- `docs/TESTING.md`

And keep learnings here:
- `docs/DECISIONS.md`
